- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PinetheApple
- Iâ€™m interested in Java and Python programming.
- Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in computer science and learning random stuff online like discord bot development and html.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on discord bot dev, android studio projects and pretty much anything coding related lol.
- How to reach me- discord (ãƒ•ã‚£ãƒ¬ãƒƒãƒˆ (Pine)#8464) is probably the best way
